<summary>Consideration for Public DNS services</summary>

* Name of Zone must be unique within the RG and Zone must not exist already&#x20;
* Same Zone name can be reused in a different RG or a different Azure Subscription&#x20;
* Where Multiple zones shares the same name, each instance is assigned different name server addresses&#x20;
* Root/Parent domain is registered at the registrar and pointed to Azure NS&#x20;
* Child domains are registered in AzureDNS directly
